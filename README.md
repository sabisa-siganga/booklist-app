# Book List Page

This project is a web application aimed at managing a list of books. It includes features such as displaying a list of books with their titles, authors, and prices, as well as allowing users to add new books via a form. The application also supports multilingual functionality, allowing users to switch between English and Dutch languages.

## Thought Process

- **Main Page with Book List:** The main objective is to provide users with a clear and organized view of the available books. Each book should be represented with its title, author, and price for easy browsing.

- **Add Book Form:** To enable users to contribute to the book list, a separate form page is essential. This form should collect necessary information such as the book's title, author, and price. Client-side validation ensures that submitted data is accurate and complete.

- **Multilingual Support:** Considering potential international users, implementing basic multilingual support enhances accessibility. By allowing users to switch between English and Dutch languages, I ensure that textual content is understandable and user-friendly.

- **Navigation:** Seamless navigation between the main page and the add book form page improves user experience. Clear and intuitive navigation enhances usability and encourages user engagement.

- **Optimization and Best Practices:** Prioritizing performance optimization and adhering to coding best practices ensures that the application runs smoothly and efficiently. Clean and well-commented code facilitates maintenance and collaboration among developers.

- **Enhanced SEO Performance:** Leveraging Next.js features for improved SEO performance increases the visibility and discoverability of the application. Implementing SEO best practices enhances the application's reach and engagement.

- **Persistent Submissions:** Enabling persistence of submissions across page reloads and sharing between users enhances user experience and data integrity. By storing submissions securely, users can access their data seamlessly, promoting user satisfaction and retention.
